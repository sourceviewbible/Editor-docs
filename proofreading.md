# Proofreading

Proofreading is an essential part to this process. When you are making your own book or website or whatever, there is license for error. And we give grace to people who create their own things. However, when we work with the Word of God, that grace is rarely extended. People who would read your work might discard it completely if they find that it is prone to error. 

Proofreading is the process of checking our work again and again to make sure that there are no errors. We want to provide our readers with the greatest level of accuracy when they read the biblical text, the footnotes and the SourceView format.

We have developed a process for proofreading that should help us to eliminate as many human errors as possible.

## Principle \#1: More Eyes, More Accuracy

It's a strange human phenomenon that we continually miss our own errors when we proofread our own work. SourceView requires at least two \(2\) sets of eyes checking each part of the work. We would recommend having more people than that.

## Principle \#2: Expect Errors, Check Everything

While we'd like to believe that we do everything right the first time, that is often not the case. It is important to check _**EVERYTHING**_ because we _**WILL**_ find errors. Please do not skip over even one footnote mark or Source =&gt; Recipient name in the process. We as a SourceView team are constantly keeping our eyes open for potential errors within our own data sets.

## Principle \#3: Get User-like Proofreading

One interesting methodology that we have used in the past is to invite people to use the SourceView Reader as regular users would and ask them to let us know if they see anything that might not be correct. This has often led to discoveries of errors in our own proofreading and has allowed for immediate feedback from potential users.

When you are ready for this stage \(which would be the last\) of the proofreading process, we will create a separate SourceView Reader App for your language so that your user-like proofreaders can really experience what it will be like for your future users. Please notify the SourceView team to do that: sourceviewteam@gmail.com

The way that we do this is to get people into reading groups and ask them to follow these basic instructions:

### Step \#1: Each person reads a color aloud:

### Step \#2: Discuss the questions at the end of the segment:

### Who can be User-like proofreaders?

Your user-like proofreaders should not be the general public, but a select group of testers \(1-5 different reading groups\). It could be your own ministry team \(we've used [YWAM DTS](https://www.ywam.org/dts/) students for this\) or family members, but the work shouldn't be made public to others \(please don't announce this in your church yet!\).

## Getting Started With The Proofreading Process

Please take the time to go through each step carefully, one at a time. 

1. Verify the correct Source =&gt; Recipient information
2. Verify Paragraph breaks and tabs in correct places
3. Verify Poetry highlights
4. Verify Embedded Docs
5. Verify Footnotes
