# Toolbar

These are the buttons that you will need to use and understand in order to make sure the introductions are properly formatted:

### SUBTITLES

### HARD SPACE

We use a hard space between all the book names and references. We do this so that they don't break up when they are at the end of a line. Please pay attention to this because it's important for the display of the references in the Reader and the App.

### SMALL CAPS

There are references to God's name in the intros and if your language using small caps for the name of God, please format that appropriately. Follow the use of small caps in the English as a guide.

### HIGHLIGHTERS

We use highlighters to call attention to things.   
The yellow highlighted text is used for questions or problems with translation that we need to look at. The user who is translating is most likely to use this highlighter to process the text with the SourceView team.

The blue highlighter is used to show which cited texts should be exactly as they are in the version you are using. When the text is in blue, you will need to check what your version's words are for that passage and use them in that place.

### LISTS

In some introductions we use lists. Use the unordered list if the English uses it. Use the numbered list if the English uses it. Please stay aligned to what is done in English.

### TABLE

There are a few tables in the introductions that we use. You probably won't need to use this button because the tables are already created. Your role as the translator will be to simply modify the text within the tables.
