# Best Practices \(Formatting\)

It is important to have a process that will help us to eliminate human error and create a pattern for our work. Focusing on one \(1\) task at a time helps us to do a great job on that single task. Below we list the order in which we complete these things and the instructions for each of these tasks. Please follow the instructions closely.

Formatting Process:

1. [Sourcify the text](sourcify-the-text.md)
2. [Format Paragraphs](format-paragraphs.md)
3. [Format Poetry](format-poetry.md)
4. [Format Embedded Docs](format-embedded-docs.md)
5. [Format Footnotes](format-footnotes.md)
6. [Move on to Key Passage Cleanup](../../sphereview-key-passages.md)
