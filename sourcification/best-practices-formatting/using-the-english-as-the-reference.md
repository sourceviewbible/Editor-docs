# Using the English as the reference

It's important to make sure that each new version follows the English as its foundation. There will probably be some minor differences between your version of the Bible and the English, but we need to work through those changes together and decide on the best way forward.

One key practice that we recommend is to open up a separate window/tab in your browser with a second SourceView Editor page. On this second page you should choose **"English"** as the language and **"New Living Translation \(Whole Bible\)"** as your version. This will be the example to follow.

If your version is different from the New Living Translation in English, it may be helpful to check a second English version called **"WEB - Winfred Henson \(NT or OT\)"**. Usually all versions will be close to one of these English versions.

These English references will help you decide which [Source =&gt; Recipient button](../bible-text-editor/source-greater-than-recipient-buttons.md) needs to be used for each speaking part. _**Copy what what chosen in the English. Thank you.**_
