# Format Paragraphs

Paragraphs are unique to each version of the Bible. We choose to honor the paragraph breaks that the translators and publishers have chosen. You will need to follow the exact paragraph breaks that they have provided.

### How to format paragraphs

1. Place the cursor _**before**_ the first character in the paragraph
2. Press SHIFT and ENTER \(this should create a line break and an automatic indentation\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: there should be no space between the indent and the first character \(whether it's a chapter/verse reference number  or the first letter of the first word\).
{% endhint %}

### Special cases

If the beginning of the paragraph occurs in the beginning of a speech bubble or narrator block of text, the line break will already be there because of the differences of colored text. In order to display the paragraph break you will need to create the indentation. To do that you would just press the TAB key one \(1\) time.

### Poetry Paragraph Breaks

Poetry has the same paragraph breaks as the prose \(regular text\). Therefore you would use the same command to create that paragraph break \(SHIFT and ENTER ... or ... just a TAB if it's the beginning of a new color block\).

### Poetry Line Breaks 

Poetry line breaks _**DO NOT**_ include tab indentations. To achieve this regular line break simply press CTRL and ENTER. This will create a line break without an indentation.
