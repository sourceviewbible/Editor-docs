# Instructions Per Chapter

In this section you can find unique instructions for each chapter of the Bible. Some chapters have poetry highlights, others have embedded documents and many have both. We have created this section as a tool for you to find out what unique instructions there are for the chapter that you are working on. Hopefully this can help you find what you're looking for.

Currently, only the books with links are available. We will continually be adding more books as we go along.
