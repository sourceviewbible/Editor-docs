# SourceView Bible Editor

## Welcome!

The SourceView Bible Editor is a tool that formats the biblical text of a given language so that it can be used in the [SourceView Bible App](http://sourceviewbible.com/) and the [SourceView Reader](https://sourceviewbible.github.io/). You are some of the first users to try out this tool, so please inform us if you experience any bugs. Thanks.

On the left of your screen is a table of contents to help walk you through the Editor.

We're excited to partner with you to see the SourceView Tool serving your people, your language and the nations of this earth.
